# Session-Tracking-Types
There are different session tracking methods which I studied in my Home Assignment for Web Technologies.
Session Tracking is a way to maintain state (data) of an user. Session tracking is mechanism of 
tracking the client provided data and making it available to the next request from the same client. 
And this process is continued until the user choose to Logout or terminate the session.
Http protocol is a stateless so we need to maintain state using session tracking techniques. Each 
time user requests the server the server treats the request as the new request. So we need to maintain 
the state of an user to recognize to particular user. Session tracking is a mechanism that servlets 
use to maintain state about a series of requests from the same user (that is, requests originating 
from same browser).

Session Tracking methods:-
1. User Authorization
2. Cookies
3. URL Rewriting
4. Hidden field
